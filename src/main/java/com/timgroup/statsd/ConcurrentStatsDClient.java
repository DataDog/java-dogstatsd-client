/**
 * A StatsDClient implementation for usage in highly threaded situation.
 * <p> Under high load, the {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} used by
 * {@link NonBlockingStatsDClient} for inter-thread communication can become a contention point,
 * since multiple thread are trying to obtain the Write Lock on the queue to insert metrics
 * elements. With the {@link ConcurrentStatsDClient}, it uses a non-blocking, lock-free queue for
 * inter-thread communication which remove that contention point. However, since this is a
 * non-blocking queue, the background thread needs to wait for element to come into the queue
 * using a separate mechanism; currently it  uses {@link Thread#sleep(long)} to achieve this,
 * which may hurt metric reporting and responsiveness. </p>
 * <p> {@link NonBlockingStatsDClient} will perform better than {@link ConcurrentStatsDClient}
 * under low to moderate load, but {@link ConcurrentStatsDClient} outperforms
 * {@link NonBlockingStatsDClient} under moderate to high load. Proper benchmarking by the client
 * application needs to be done to decide which implementation to choose from.</p>
 * <p>Thread-safety note: this class is safe to use by multiple thread without external
 * synchronization.</p>
