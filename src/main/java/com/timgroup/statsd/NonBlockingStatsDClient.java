/**
 * A simple StatsD client implementation facilitating metrics recording.
 *
 * <p>Upon instantiation, this client will establish a socket connection to a StatsD instance
 * running on the specified host and port. Metrics are then sent over this connection as they are
 * received by the client.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Three key methods are provided for the submission of data-points for the application under
 * scrutiny:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #incrementCounter} - adds one to the value of the specified named counter</li>
 *   <li>{@link #recordGaugeValue} - records the latest fixed value for the specified named gauge</li>
 *   <li>{@link #recordExecutionTime} - records an execution time in milliseconds for the specified named operation</li>
 *   <li>{@link #recordHistogramValue} - records a value, to be tracked with average, maximum, and percentiles</li>
 *   <li>{@link #recordEvent} - records an event</li>
 *   <li>{@link #recordSetValue} - records a value in a set</li>
 * </ul>
 * From the perspective of the application, these methods are non-blocking, with the resulting
 * IO operations being carried out in a separate thread. Furthermore, these methods are guaranteed
 * not to throw an exception which may disrupt application execution.
 *
 * <p>As part of a clean system shutdown, the {@link #stop()} method should be invoked
 * on any StatsD clients.</p>
